                    Kevin never looked back from the journey he‚Äôs undergone within the fitness industry. 
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin started out as a Lifeguard and a Gym Instructor at the age of 17 in a corporate health club in Norwich. Kevin then progressed as a freelance personal trainer and group exercise class instructor. 
                    <br><br>
                    He later worked as a self-employed personal trainer across various gyms in Norwich. 
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn‚Äôt until 2010 he got his first opportunity to start teaching fitness courses. After graduating from Anglia Ruskin, Kevin worked as a teacher and a sport scientist within professional football. He worked with clubs such as Peterborough United and Norwich City F.C.
                    <br><br>
                    After delivering fitness courses in Dubai, Kevin identified the need for quality fitness education in Norfolk and the UAE. ‚ÄúI decided to create Norfolk Health & Fitness as a way of providing affordable access to quality fitness qualifications‚Äù.
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin has now partnered with Active IQ and a team of experienced and passionate tutors. This has allowed him to certify students from various backgrounds and learning requirements.
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin has now qualified over 600 personal trainers in the UK üá¨üáß and Dubai üá¶üá™.

                    <br><br>
                    Throughout this period, he has accumulated countless hours of hands on practical coaching experience, experience that can only truly be obtained through spending so many hours on the gym floor. However, it is this time and experience that enables him to deliver the very best guidance to you.

                    Matt first began his journey into fitness at the age of 7 when he entered his first martial arts class. Since then, he has managed to earn a 4th degree black belt and have had the opportunity to train and coach in the United States, Australia and Europe.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to this he has continued to study and work with some of the best coaches in the country, attending regular courses in weightlifting, martial arts, and nutrition, constantly aiming to continue his development within the fitness industry, whilst passing this knowledge on to others.
                    <br><br>
                    Over recent years he has worked not only as a personal trainer but also as an exercise referral consultant, working alongside GP‚Äôs, Physiotherapists, an educational course tutor and an NVQ training assessor.
