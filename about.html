                    Kevin never looked back from the journey he’s undergone within the fitness industry. 
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin started out as a Lifeguard and a Gym Instructor at the age of 17 in a corporate health club in Norwich. Kevin then progressed as a freelance personal trainer and group exercise class instructor. 
                    <br><br>
                    He later worked as a self-employed personal trainer across various gyms in Norwich. 
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t until 2010 he got his first opportunity to start teaching fitness courses. After graduating from Anglia Ruskin, Kevin worked as a teacher and a sport scientist within professional football. He worked with clubs such as Peterborough United and Norwich City F.C.
                    <br><br>
                    After delivering fitness courses in Dubai, Kevin identified the need for quality fitness education in Norfolk and the UAE. “I decided to create Norfolk Health & Fitness as a way of providing affordable access to quality fitness qualifications”.
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin has now partnered with Active IQ and a team of experienced and passionate tutors. This has allowed him to certify students from various backgrounds and learning requirements.
                    <br><br>
                    Kevin has now qualified over 600 personal trainers in the UK 🇬🇧 and Dubai 🇦🇪.
